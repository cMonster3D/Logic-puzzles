Note on assumption: In the logic puzzle titled "Alien invasion" I had to make
an assumption that was neither explicit nor implicit in the instructions.
The assumption was that each toy was picked by one of the kids i.e.
no toy was picked twice (or more) and no toy was left un-picked.

The error in the instructions occurs in the below sentence fragment which is
a word for word excerpt from the instructions and begins on the 5th line of the
given instructions.

... four lucky children (including Georgina) left the store
happily clutching a bag containing one of four different aliens ...

a simplified version of that sentence fragment reads

... four children left with one of four different aliens ...

This indicates that each child chose an alien though it does not indicate that
all of the 4 possible aliens were chosen.

My assumption is that all of the 4 possible aliens were chosen.

I found that by making this assumption the puzzle was solvable.

Thank you.
